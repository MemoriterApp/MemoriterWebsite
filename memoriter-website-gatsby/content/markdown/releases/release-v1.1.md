# Memoriter v1.1

This update a few new features were added, as well as visual improvements. The main focus has been that the way to study with Memoriter is improved. Therefore a new study mode to practice flashcards was implemented. Furthermore the overall user experience, as well as the application performance, was improved.

## New Features

The main feature of the update is the study mode. On the flashcard overview page a button is now displayed to use it. With this mode, you can query, study and repeat flashcards in a random order. When entering the study mode, a random flashcard of this folder will be shown, but only the title is shown, the answer is hidden. When clicking the flashcard, you have the option to mark a card as either correct to remove it from the session or incorrect to repeat it again later.

Next to the study mode we now provide the option to hide the flashcard content by default and only show it when hovering or selecting the card.

Next to the studying related features, a few other features were implemented to improve the user experience. Firstly the flashcard text editor was improved, now allowing some formatting options to highlight certain parts of the text. Next to the text editing options, more account management options were added. Now it is possible to change your email address or password or to send a password reset link if you forgot it.

## Minor Changes

- Some aspects of the visual design of the application were changed and improved, for isnatance an optional light theme was added.
- The sizes of flashcards are dynamically changing based on the text length for a better looking layout and better usage of space.
- The release notes were implemented to document changes.
- We have added a form at the bottom of each page to report issues.

## Bugfixes and Tweaks

- Queries from the database were dramatically reduced, leading to faster loading times and less bandwidth usage.
- Some parts of the application are better optimized for mobile devices (even though we created some new issues).
