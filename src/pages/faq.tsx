      question: 'What exactly is Memoriter?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          Memoriter is a note taking study tool. It was designed to store and study information in a
          clear and effective way. The application is still in a very early stage of development,
          but as the time progresses there will be more features added to make the studying
          experience with Memoriter even more comprehensive.

      question: 'Who created Memoriter?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          Memoriter is a tool for students by students. It was originally started as a school
          project by a small team of German students in 2021, but we moved on afterwards and are now
          a still small, but international organization. Head over to our{' '}

      question: 'Is Memoriter free?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          Yes! The application is completely free to use at the moment. Memoriter is currently a non
          profit project, we do not have an incentive to make money off of it. With the project
          beeing very small at the moment, our operative costs are little, so we are able to do so.

    {
      section: 'general',
      question: 'Why is Memoriter structured in this way?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          There are already good note taking and study programs, but there isn't really a good tool
          which combines or provides both aspects in one app. Therefore we tried to provide multiple
          aspects of learning and use those scientific principles to create an all-in-one study
          experience.

    {
      section: 'general',
      question: 'Why are there so many inconsistencies in the visual design?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          There are multiple reasons for this. Firstly we are mostly developers with little design
          experience and we hadn't a person creating a proper deisgn in the for a long time, but now
          the situation should get better. Secondly the beginning of development was very
          unorganized and everyone implemented their own ideas, leading to different design choices
          before we acquired a person doing all the visual stuff.

      question: 'Can I delete my user data?',
      answer: (
        <p>
          All your folders and flashcards get removed if you delete your account. If you just want
          to clear your user data, you can then reopen an account with the same email address.

        <p>
          Sadly no. Once an account is closed, all corresponding user data is deleted. It is
          possible opening an account with the same email address though.

      answer: (
        <p>
          We use the money to cover or operative costs and to expand the project. That means that we
          are using some of it to speed up development or for marketing reasons, but most of it will
          be used to cover cloud service and server costs. On the{' '}

        <p>
          Sadly no, at least at the moment. The beginning of development were very unorganized, so
          no one really cared about documenting anything, and with our code beeing very chaotic
          (even the people who wrote it don't understand it{' '}
