# Memoriter v1.2: Adiutor potens

While working on this update, we redirected our focus to AI and incorporated new features such as a Discord Bot, an AI tutor to speed up homework, and flashcard suggestions for easy creation. We also revamped our startpage to be more visually appealing and added more features. Additionally, we implemented a spaced repetition algorithm for flashcards to enhance memorization and made various design improvements to modernize the website

## New Features

The most notable addition to this update is the incorporation of AI features, added by Johan. The AI now suggests answers for flashcards, enabling faster creation. Johan also added CheatPT-3, an AI tutor in the form of a Discord Bot, it assists with homework and flashcard creation. Please note that this feature is currently in beta and may have bugs. Feedback and suggestions are welcome. To further support homework assistance, Simon K. created a community on Discord for users to ask questions and receive help. Join the community at this link: https://discord.gg/6Z2Z7Y4 and aim to grow it to be a helpful place for homework assistance.

Simon H. created this beautiful startpage, which has a lot more features than the old one. It also looks a lot nicer and more modern. We will be adding more features to the startpage in the future, if you have any suggestions, please let us know.

Alex and Simon H. implemented a spaced repetition algorithm to the flashcards to aid in longer-term memorization. You can access the study mode by clicking on the "study" button and selecting your preferred mode.
