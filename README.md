# Memoriter Website

This repository contains the source code of the informational website
[memoriter.de](https://memoriter.de) for the note taking and study tool
Memoriter. For more information, please check out our
[main repository](https://github.com/MemoriterApp/Memoriter) for the Memoriter
web application.

## What is Memoriter?

Memoriter is a web application with the focus of combining a note taking program
with a quiz or study system. The app is currently in a very early stage of
development and therefore not very comprehensive, but more features will be
added in the future. The inspirations for Memoriter were programs like Google
Keep, Notion, Quizlet and Anki.

This repository only contains the informational website about the project. The
actual repository containing the application can be found
[here](https://github.com/MemoriterApp/Memoriter).
