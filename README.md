# Memoriter Website
This repository contains the source code of the informational website [www.memoriter.de](https://www.memoriter.de) for the note taking and study tool Memoriter. For more information, please check out our [main repository](https://github.com/MemoriterApp/Memoriter) for the Memoriter web application.

## What is Memoriter?
Memoriter is a web application with the focus of combining a note taking program with a quiz or study system. The app is currently in a very early stage of development and therefore not very comprehensive, but more features will be added in the future. The inspirations for Memoriter were programs like Google Keep, Notion, Quizlet and Anki.

This repository only contains the informational website about the project. The actual repository containing the application can be found [here](https://github.com/MemoriterApp/Memoriter).

## Contributing
Memoriter is a more personal project of our small team and the informational website won't be changed much in the future, so we are unlikely to accept any pull requests, yet feel free to report issues or propose changes. Our main focus lies on the actual web application repository, so please consider reporting issues there instead of here. Please also check out our own [bug report page](https://www.memoriter.de/bugs).
